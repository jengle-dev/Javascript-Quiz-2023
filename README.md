# JavaScript Quiz
## Description
The goal of this project is to create a timed quiz over JavaScript Coding.

The quiz would allow 15 minutes total. Each correct answer is tallied and stored in local storage. Each incorrect answer will not add to the tally but will deduct 30 seconds from the overall time. There are 10 questions. This allows for 1.5 minutes per question if answered correctly.

Once the time runs out or the user completes all 10 questions, the page will prompt for initials and save high score, if the user wishes.
